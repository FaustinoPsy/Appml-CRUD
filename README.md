AppML Brings Data to HTML

"No Nonsense Web Applications"

Introduction
The Web is growing fast, and the amount of data in Cyberspace is growing even faster.

Every day new information systems are developed, and every day new users are connected, and data can be accessed 24/7 from anywhere in the world.

Faster and better software development methods are desperately needed.

Along these lines, W3Schools has developed a very flexible technique for retrieving, displaying, and manipulate data, without the need for traditional programming.

Cooperating with Jan Egil Refsnes, W3schools has developed a vocabulary for defining Web applications. The vocabulary is called AppML (Application Modeling Language).

AppML uses the most up-to-date techniques and ideas of modern Web development with focus on:

Low Cost
Rapid and Agile Web Develoment
Optimized for Cloud Computing
High Speed and Low Bandwidth Consumption
MVC (Model Viev Controller) Architecture
Full Separation of Content from Presentation
Highly Scalable and Testable
Easy Configuration and Reconfiguration
AppML supports the functions you find in other frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, but AppML is much easier to use, and much easier to understand.

What is AppML?
AppML stands for Application Modeling Language.

AppML is not a programming language. It is descriptive language (a language for describing applications).

It is built around familiar Web application concepts like:

Forms
Lists
Reports
Filters
Functions
Databases
AppML runs in any HTML page. No installation is required.

AppML is a tool for bringing data to HTML applications:

From Objects
From JSON files
From Text files
From XML files
From databases
